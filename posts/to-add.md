- Update CSS to Tailwind, add SASS
- Visitor Contact form
- Links to outside pages
- Better styling of default Layout
- I like the idea of writing static posts then updating them, but a way to add posts from the deployment would be nice. A form on a private or restricted route may solve this?
- Possible refactor to accomodate expansion into multi-user application.
